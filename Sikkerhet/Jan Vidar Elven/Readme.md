# SESSION INFORMATION

## Title

Security Infrastrucure as Code for Entra ID and Graph API

## Description

This highly technical and demo-heavy session will look into the recently announced public preview (MS Build, May 2024) of the Graph resource support from Bicep, and compare usage scenarios to those already available via Terraform. We will look into how to combine traditional Azure resource deployments together with Entra ID and Graph API resources, moving even more deployment scenarios to declarative infrastructure-as-code, both for local deployment and for DevOps pipelines or actions.

## Speaker

Jan Vidar Elven, MVP Security, Senior Architect, Evidi AS

## Resources

Presentation slides, Bicep and Terraform examples, DevOps pipelines.
