# MVP-Dagene-2024

## Content

Presentations and shared demo resources for the MVP Dagen(e) 2024 event in Oslo 23. and 24. October.

It is up to the speaker if presentations are shared and with or without demo resources. Some speakers share on their own platforms, if so we will try to add links here to outside content.

Content is shared in subfolders representing tracks, and subfolder for each speaker:

- Sikkerhet (Wednesday)
- Azure og DevOps (Wednesday)
- Modern Work (Thursday)
- Power Platform og Dynamics 365 FO/BC/CE
